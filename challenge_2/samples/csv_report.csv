//children won't be part of the fields list
//find children and splice the children OR copy a slice without it
//this will allow recursion to get all other properties for each line
//and children is still there to recurse on
//loop through keys on each person and create a line
//for all but last character add a comma, then add a newline character
//then add that line to the bigger results var
//recursively go through the next child/person
//check for children
//if children recurse
//return end results

// How do I ignore children
